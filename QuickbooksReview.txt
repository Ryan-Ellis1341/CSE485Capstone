This is a description of the Quickbooks linkage in the backend code:
This code defines a function that connects to the QuickBooks Online (QBO) API to retrieve a company’s Profit and Loss (P&L) report for a given date range. 
It sends an authenticated GET request using the company ID and bearer token, then parses the JSON response returned by QBO. 
The function extracts each account’s monthly amounts, skips summary rows, and flattens the nested data into a clean pandas DataFrame with three columns:
`account`, `month`, and `amount`. The result is an easy-to-analyze table showing how much money each account earned or spent each month within the specified period.

I also researched what Quickbooks is:
QuickBooks is a popular accounting software developed by Intuit that helps businesses manage their finances. It’s used to track income and expenses, create invoices, 
handle payroll, manage bills, and generate financial reports like Profit & Loss or Balance Sheets. QuickBooks can connect to bank accounts, automate transaction 
categorization, and support multiple users. It’s commonly used by small and medium-sized businesses because it simplifies bookkeeping and provides real-time 
financial insights without needing deep accounting expertise.
