Objective

This document outlines the planned external integrations for the Endless Moments LLC – AI-Driven Budgeting Suite. These integrations will enable the system to leverage cloud-based services and AI-driven insights to enhance functionality, scalability, and user experience.

Planned Integrations
Integration / Service	Type	Purpose	Status
React Framework	Frontend Library	Provides a responsive, component-based user interface for the Budgeting Suite, supporting interactive dashboards and real-time data visualization.	Planned
OpenAI API	AI/ML Service	Generates AI-driven financial summaries, natural language insights, and contextual recommendations for budgeting and forecasting modules.	Planned
Appwrite / PostgreSQL	Backend & Database Service	Manages authentication, data storage, and real-time updates for user and financial data within the budgeting system.	Planned
AWS Cloud Services (proposed)	Cloud Infrastructure	Hosts the application and supports scalable storage, deployment, and performance optimization for production use.	Planned
Accounting Software Integrations (QuickBooks, Xero – future phase)	External API Integration	Enables seamless import/export of financial transactions and chart of accounts data to ensure compatibility with existing accounting systems.	Planned
Acceptance Criteria

The system architecture must support secure API connectivity for all planned external integrations.

Data transmitted between the budgeting suite and external services must be encrypted and follow standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

Integration endpoints and keys must be configurable for future deployment environments.

Documentation for each external service must be included in the system’s integration guide.

The OpenAI API integration must successfully generate and display AI-driven summaries for at least one test dataset before final acceptance.
