This is the entry point of a React application, the main file that starts and renders the whole app into the browser. 
The first code line imports the React library, which is needed to use JSX. The second line imports the createRoot function from React DOM.
It replaces the older ReactDOM.render() and is used to render the React app into the web page.
The third line imports BrowserRouter from the React Router library. This component enables client-side routing, allowing the app to have multiple pages (URLs) 
without reloading the page. The fourth line imports the main App component from another file. The fifth line imports the styles.css component.
This file sets up React to render your main app component, and gives the app routing support.
