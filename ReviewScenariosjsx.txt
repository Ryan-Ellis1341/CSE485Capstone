This React component provides a simple user interface for managing financial or forecasting scenarios through API calls. 
It allows users to clone an existing scenario with a specified percentage uplift and apply sensitivity adjustments to 
modify certain account patterns by a given percentage. Using Reactâ€™s useState for managing form inputs and messages, 
the component interacts with backend endpoints (/scenario/clone and /scenario/sensitivity) through an authenticated API client created with makeClient. 
The interface displays input fields for scenario parameters, buttons to trigger the operations, 
and status messages to inform the user of the result, all styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.
