On the versions Page there seems to be two errors with both the list and save button.I am finding an error where it shows:
 INFO:     127.0.0.1:55933 - "OPTIONS /versions/list?scenario=2027:Base HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
This type of error usually means that you are using the right Url but the wrong method meaning instead of get it is using post.
The above error was for the list button but you receive the exact same error with the save button. I believe a possible solution to this problem is just changing the method.
