Varshini Muniswaran- Determine which variables users should be able to adjust

Main functions:
⦁	Budget Creation-> users will need to adjust budget categories and amount per category
⦁	Expense Tracking-> Not much to adjust
⦁	Forecasting-> Most scenario variables. Forecast horizon and acceptable error margin
⦁	Reporting-> Output customization
⦁	User Management-> No user-adjustable variables

Mapping variables to main functions and applying constraints:
Limit to 5-6 adjustable variables to avoid overwhelming users; all adjustments should fall within reasonable bounds.

We get:
1.	Revenue Growth %-> Users simulate "What if" scenarios with an increase or decrease in sales
2.	Fixed costs-> Adjusting fixed overheads like rent, utilities
3.	Variable costs-> Adjust inventory cost assumptions
4.	Seasonality-> Users can adjust for expected holidays or seasonal spikes/dips
5.	Expense Category Allocation-> Allocate % spend across top categories
