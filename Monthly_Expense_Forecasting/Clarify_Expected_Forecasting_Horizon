Ryan Ellis - Clarify expected forecasting horizon.

As far as how data should be broken up and organized I see a few rather clear divisions.
The first 3 being the most basic, 1. Money going out(Expenses), 2. Money coming in(Revenue), 3. Company Info.
From those 3 you will have sub catagories that get broken down such as: name, size, and location for company data.

One of the most important splits to emphasize is the income vs expenses to ensure no confusion is had by machine or user as to 
money coming in or leaving.  This could be seperated easieat via clear seperate tabs, ensuring the info could
never even be shown at the same time.

Another item to keep in mind is the clarity to what of that data is willing to be shared with the AI
for learning and what is not allowed to be shared, and that line could be somewhere between those 3 catagories.
