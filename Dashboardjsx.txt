After reading through the Dashboard.jsx file  I have understood that it is basically a web dashboard that shows the financial performance. 
You can also see snippets where it is connecting to an API and fetching information and then displaying said information. 
One thing it fetches from the API is a basic financial summary of the business. 
It also uses AI to predict potential future revenue and then displays that prediction. 
To summarize the file essentially creates a neat dashboard that displays live information in an organized manner
