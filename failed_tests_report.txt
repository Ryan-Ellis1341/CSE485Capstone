Failed test details:

test_api.py Ñ failing test

Failing test: fpna_fullstack_v2-2/backend/tests/test_api.py::test_bva_viewer_allowed

Error message:

KeyError: 'amount'

Interpretation:

The test attempted to access a key/column named 'amount' in a pandas DataFrame (or similar mapping) but that column does not exist in the data produced during the test run. 

Likely causes are:

The code now produces a different schema (for example columns like amount_actual / amount_budget instead of amount), the test's fixture / golden data no longer contains amount, or a transformation step removed/renamed the column unintentionally.
